# Introduction
BBOA are important for the radiative effect but the magnitude and even direction are unclear
(Haywood et al, 2000).
Our measurements set out to add to this body of knowledge using mass Spectrometer data
(Allan et al, 2001).

#Simulations
John's box model is consistent with coagulation as the dominant growth mechanism.

#methodology
we USed a TOF-AMS to measure aerosol mass and composition (smith et al, 1998).

#Results
We report a change in composition with atmospheric age. This is directly linked to the scattering
properties of the particles.

#Figures
Draft figures, so the figures go in a section of their own.

#Conclusion
If your reading this Gerard, I just copied your story.
